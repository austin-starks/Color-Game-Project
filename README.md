# Color Game Project
RGB color guessing game created to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project was inspired made after watching a similar example on the Web Developer's Bootcamp. I made this project to demonstrate my ability to code in basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

In the game, 3 or 6 colors appear on the screen (depending on the difficulty) and the goal is to guess the correct RGB color displayed from the options. 

I also implemented a score. The score multiplier increases the more colors the user gets correct in a row. If you get a color wrong, refresh the page, or reset the colors, the score returns to 0.
